You will first choose which character you would like, which types of animals you would like to interact with, and which food you would like to feed those animals. You will give the player basic side-to-side movement just like you did in Prototype 1, but then you will use if-then statements to keep the Player in bounds. Project Outcome:The player will be able to move left and right on the screen based on the user’s left and right key presses, but will not be able to leave the play area on either side."
Lesson 2.2 - Food Flight,https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/67542b74edbc2a09823fd7cf?utm_campaign=092025_d7ace223-e908-44dc-bf78-8bdb5ff05f9e&utm_medium=LMS&utm_source=outline&version=6.0,Tutorial,01:10:00,"Overview: In this lesson, you will allow the player to launch the projectile through the scene. First you will write a new script to send the projectile forwards. Next you will store the projectile along with all of its scripts and properties using an important new concept in Unity called Prefabs. The player will be able to launch the projectile prefab with a tap of the spacebar. Finally, you will add boundaries to the scene, removing any objects that leave the screen. Project Outcome:The player will be able to press the Spacebar and launch a projectile prefab into the scene, which destroys itself when it leaves the game’s boundaries. The animals will also be removed from the scene when they leave the game boundaries."

In this lesson we will allow the animals to spawn on their own, in a random location at the top of the screen. In order to do so, we will create a new object and a new script to manage the entire spawning process. Project Outcome:When the user presses the S key, a randomly selected animal will spawn at a random position at the top of the screen, walking towards the player."
Lesson 2.4 - Collision Decisions,https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/67558690edbc2a0c109fb699?utm_campaign=092025_d7ace223-e908-44dc-bf78-8bdb5ff05f9e&utm_medium=LMS&utm_source=outline&version=6.0,Tutorial,00:50:00,"Overview: Our game is coming along nicely, but there are are some critical things we must add before it’s finished. First off, instead of pressing S to spawn the animals, we will spawn them on a timer so that they appear every few seconds. Next we will add colliders to all of our prefabs and make it so launching a projectile into an animal will destroy it. Finally, we will display a “Game Over” message if any animals make it past the player.Project Outcome:The animals will spawn on a timed interval and walk down the screen, triggering a “Game Over” message if they make it past the player. If the player hits them with a projectile to feed them, they will be destroyed."

We will start by creating a new project and importing the starter files. Next we will choose a beautiful background and a character for the player to control, and allow that character to jump with a tap of the spacebar. We will also choose an obstacle for the player, and create a spawn manager that throws them in the player’s path at timed intervals. Project Outcome:The character, background, and obstacle of your choice will be set up. The player will be able to press spacebar and make the character jump, as obstacles spawn at the edge of the screen and block the player’s path."
Lesson 3.2 - Make the World Whiz By,https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/6752352eedbc2a00ee808349?utm_campaign=092025_d7ace223-e908-44dc-bf78-8bdb5ff05f9e&utm_medium=LMS&utm_source=outline&version=6.0,Tutorial,01:10:00,"Overview: We’ve got the core mechanics of this game figured out: The player can tap the spacebar to jump over incoming obstacles. However, the player appears to be running for the first few seconds, but then the background just disappears! In order to fix this, we need to repeat the background seamlessly to make it look like the world is rushing by! We also need the game to halt when the player collides with an obstacle, stopping the background from repeating and stopping the obstacles from spawning. Lastly, we must destroy any obstacles that get past the player.Project Outcome:The background moves flawlessly at the same time as the obstacles, and the obstacles will despawn when they exit game boundaries. With the power of script communication, the background and spawn manager will halt when the player collides with an obstacle. Colliding with an obstacle will also trigger a game over message in the console log, halting the background and the spawn manager."
Lesson 3.3 - Don't Just Stand There,https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/67537eb0edbc2a04fe5602e6?utm_campaign=092025_d7ace223-e908-44dc-bf78-8bdb5ff05f9e&utm_medium=LMS&utm_source=outline&version=6.0,Tutorial,01:00:00,"Overview: The game is looking great so far, but the player character is a bit… lifeless. Instead of the character simply sliding across the ground, we’re going to give it animations for running, jumping, and even death! We will also tweak the speed of these animations, timing them so they look perfect in the game environment.Project Outcome:With the animations from the animator controller, the character will have 3 new animations that occur in 3 different game states. These states include running, jumping, and death, all of which transition smoothly and are timed to suit the game."
Lesson 3.4 - Particles and Sound Effects,https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/675399f1edbc2a078ab00ec9?utm_campaign=092025_d7ace223-e908-44dc-bf78-8bdb5ff05f9e&utm_medium=LMS&utm_source=outline&version=6.0,Tutorial,01:00:00,"Overview: This game is looking extremely good, but it’s missing something critical: Sound effects and Particle effects! Sounds and music will breathe life into an otherwise silent game world, and particles will make the player’s actions more dynamic and eye-popping. In this lesson, we will add cool sounds and particles when the character is running, jumping, and crashing.Project Outcome:Music will play as the player runs through the scene, kicking up dirt particles in a spray behind their feet. A springy sound will play as they jump and a boom will play as they crash, bursting in a cloud of smoke particles as they fall over."

In this lesson, we fill that purpose by creating an enemy to challenge the player! First we will give the enemy a texture of your choice, then give it the ability to bounce the player away... potentially knocking them off the cliff. Lastly, we will let the enemy chase the player around the island and spawn in random positions.Project Outcome:A textured and spherical enemy will spawn on the island at start, in a random location determined by a custom function. It will chase the player around the island, bouncing them off the edge if they get too close."
